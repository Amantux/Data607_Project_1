<H1> Part 1
<H2> Let's first start with loading libraries

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

<h2> Once there, lets grab our raw data and import it into a dataframe with headers

```{r}
url.data <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/majors-list.csv"

raw <- read.csv(url(url.data), header = TRUE,)
```

<h2> Let's take a quick head of the data, and see what it looks like with headers

```{r}

head(raw)

```
<H2> Now let's filter!

<H3> 
```{r}
majors<-rbind(raw[grepl("STATISTICS", raw$Major),], raw[grepl("DATA", raw$Major),])

head(majors)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
file <- "Assignment_2_Text.txt"
df <- read_delim(file, delim='"', col_names=FALSE) 
list <- c(df$X2) 
list <- (c(list, df$X4))
list <- (c(list, df$X6))
list <- (c(list, df$X8))
print(list)


```
```{r}
produce='[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"

[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  

[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    

[13] "olive"        "salal berry"'

patrn="([a-z]+.[a-z]+)"
unlist(str_extract_all(produce,pattern = patrn))
```
