This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RMariaDB)
library(DBI)
```
Looking at the data so far, its clear to me that it is a fixed width delimination

Each datum is made up of two rows

the first row is:
Number | Name | Total Points | Score

The second row is
Location | UUID | Rating Start -> Rating Endsl


```{r}
fileName="chess_scores.txt"
conn <- file(fileName,open="r")
line <-readLines(conn)
test <- list()
for (i in 4:(length(line))){
  if (!startsWith(line[i], '-')) {
    test[i] = (line[i]) 
    i = i + 1
  }
}
non_null_names <- which(!sapply(test, is.null))
result = read_delim(paste(test[non_null_names], collapse = "\n"), delim='|', col_names=FALSE)
#result = read_delim(paste(line, collapse = "\n"), delim='|')
print(result)
close(conn)
```
```{r}
row_odd <- seq_len(nrow(result)) %% 2
head(result[row_odd == 0,])
head(result[row_odd != 0,][2])
```


```{r}
Player_data <- separate(result[row_odd == 0,], 2, c("Player_ID", "Post Ranking"), sep = '->')
Player_data <- separate(Player_data, 2, c("Player_ID", "Pre Ranking"), sep = ' / R: ')
Player_Demo <- result[row_odd != 0,]
Player_Demo$Player_ID <- Player_data$Player_ID
head(Player_Demo)
head(Player_data)
```
```{r}
head(merge(Player_data, Player_Demo, by="Player_ID"))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
