This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RMariaDB)
library(DBI)
```
Looking at the data so far, its clear to me that it is a fixed width delimination

Each datum is made up of two rows

the first row is:
Number | Name | Total Points | Score

The second row is
Location | UUID | Rating Start -> Rating Endsl


```{r}
fileName="chess_scores.txt"
conn <- file(fileName,open="r")
line <-readLines(conn)
for (i in 4:length(line)){
  if (!startsWith(line[i], '-')) {
    print(line[i])  
  }
}
close(conn)
```


```{r}
current_data <- read_delim(file = "chess_scores.txt", delim = "|")
current_data
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
